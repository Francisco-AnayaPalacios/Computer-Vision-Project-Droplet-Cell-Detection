# Computer-Vision-Project-Droplet-Cell-Detection

• Designed and implemented an algorithm to detect and count microdroplets and encapsulated cells using background subtraction and contour-based detection.
• Validated accuracy with annotated ground truth (Cytomine), achieving <5% counting error while optimizing inference speed.

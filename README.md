## ðŸ”¹ Computer Vision Project â€” Droplet & Cell Detection

- Designed and implemented an algorithm to detect and count microdroplets and encapsulated cells using **background subtraction** and **contour-based detection**.  
- Validated accuracy with annotated ground truth (**Cytomine**), achieving **<5% counting error** while optimizing inference speed.  
- Contributed to a collaborative research project in **biomedical imaging**, delivering reproducible results and highlighting applications for **diagnostics and lab-on-a-chip devices**.

**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Cytomine, Matplotlib
